#Loops


# For algorithm - begin with sentry at start and add change to sentry on each pass until sentry is larger than or equal to finish
# While - initialize sentry with initialization code then continue loop as long as condition is true. Inside loop change sentry with change code

#Basic password loop. Exits with a positive result if the user chooses the right password, it exits with a negative result if the user is wrong three times
